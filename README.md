# Central Tendency Case Study: Wine Quality Dataset

This project explores the central tendencies of the "Wine Quality Dataset" using Python and focuses on understanding the distribution of key features.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based case study that analyzes the "Wine Quality Dataset" (available from [Link to Dataset Source, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository]). The primary focus is to:

* Calculate and visualize the mean, median, and mode of relevant features.
* Compare and contrast the different measures of central tendency.
* Draw insights into the distribution of wine quality and its related attributes.

## Dataset

The "Wine Quality Dataset" contains information about various physicochemical properties of red and white vinho verde wine samples, along with their quality ratings. [Briefly describe the key features, e.g., acidity, sugar, alcohol content, quality score].
