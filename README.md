# Central Tendency Case Study: Wine Quality Dataset

This project explores the central tendencies of the "Wine Quality Dataset" using Python and focuses on understanding the distribution of key features.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based case study that analyzes the "Wine Quality Dataset" (available from [Link to Dataset Source, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository]). The primary focus is to:

* Calculate and visualize the mean, median, and mode of relevant features.
* Compare and contrast the different measures of central tendency.
* Draw insights into the distribution of wine quality and its related attributes.

## Dataset

The "Wine Quality Dataset" contains information about various physicochemical properties of red and white vinho verde wine samples, along with their quality ratings. [Briefly describe the key features, e.g., acidity, sugar, alcohol content, quality score].

## Project Structure

## Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Analysis

The `wine_quality_analysis.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step analysis of the dataset, including:

1.  **Data Loading and Inspection:** Loading the dataset and checking for missing values.
2.  **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features for central tendency analysis.
3.  **Calculation of Central Tendencies:** Calculating the mean, median, and mode for selected features.
4.  **Visualization:** Creating histograms and other plots to visualize the distributions and central tendencies.
5.  **Interpretation:** Discussing the findings and comparing the different measures of central tendency.
